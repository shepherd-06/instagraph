# InstaGraph 🌐

Hello there, adventurous coder! Welcome to InstaGraph, your go-to application for converting text or URLs into insightful knowledge graphs. Curious about the relationships between entities in a complex topic? Feed the text to InstaGraph and voila! A beautiful knowledge graph is at your fingertips.

See example flowcharts generated by InstaGraph [here](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1701351068817301922).

Powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5, this Flask application turns your text into a vividly colored graph, making it easier to visualize relationships between various entities. Enough talking—let's get started!

***Author's TL;DR**: If you're just looking for how the knowledge graph is generated, check out the function call parameters taking up half of main.py.*

## Contributing 🤝

Best way to chat with me is on Twitter at [@yoheinakajima](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima). I usually only code on the weekends or at night, and in pretty small chunks. I have lots ideas on what I want to add here, but obviously this would move faster with everyone. Not sure I can manage Github well given my time constraints, so please reach out if you want to help me run the Github. Now, here are a few ideas on what I think we should add based on comments...

- ✅~~Store knowledge graph~~ (thx [@tomasonjo](https://github.com/tomasonjo)! 9/13/23)
- ✅~~Pull knowledge graph from storage~~ (thx [@tomasonjo](https://github.com/tomasonjo)! 9/13/23)
- ✅Show history
- 📝Ability to combine two graphs
- 📝Ability to combine 2+ graphs from history
- ✅~~Ability to expand on a graph~~ (thx [@tomasonjo](https://github.com/tomasonjo)! 9/13/23)
- 📝Ability to expand on graph from specific nodes
- 📝Fuzzy matching of nodes for combining graphs (vector match + LLM confirmation)

There are a lot of "build a chart" tools out there, so instead of doing user account and custom charts, it sounds more fun for me to work on building the largest knowledge graph ever...
